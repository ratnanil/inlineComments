## inlineComments: An R-Package which creates Github issues with line references

This package is an RStudio Addin which, after assigning it a keyboard shortcut, allows creating Github Issues that reference specific lines of a text file (typically .R or .Rmd).

## Installation

This package must be installed from Github (using `devtools`, for example):

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ratnanil/inlineComments")
```

Next, restart Rstudio and assign a keyboard shortcut to the addin (tools > modify keyboard shortcut). You can use `Ctr + Shift + k`.

Now highlight the lines you want to reference in the issue and hit the keyboard shortcut you just assigned. Write your comment on the issue and hit "Create issue". 

## Caveats

- the autogenerated URL includes the sha of the latest commit of your *local repo*. If you are ahead of your remote, the generated link will of course not work on Github until you have pushed your changes. However, even after pushing the changes, the lines will not be rendered in the issue. Therefore it's best to sync with your remote before using this addin
- Currently, the addin cannot handle multiple remotes. Maybe I will implement this in the future
